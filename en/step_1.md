## Introduction

Watching nature is a brilliant way to relax, but wildlife doesnâ€™t always come along when you want it to. In this project, you will make a butterfly garden where each butterfly flies in exactly the pattern you tell it to.

### What you will make

Click on the green flag, then sit back, relax, and watch the patterns that the butterflies make as they fly.
