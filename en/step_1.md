## Introduction

Watching nature is a brilliant way to relax but wildlife doesn’t always come along when you want it to. In this project you’ll make a Butterfly Garden where each butterfly flies in exactly the pattern you tell it to.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click the green flag and sit back and relax and watch the patterns the butterflies make as they fly.
