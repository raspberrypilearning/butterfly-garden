## Challenge: add to your garden

Now it's time to get creative with your butterfly garden. 

Duplicate the **Butterfly 4** sprite (the butterfly that flies around in circles) and change the amount that it moves and turns by. What happens?

Change the size of some of the butterflies so that some of them appear far away. 

Get creative and decorate your own butterfly costume with the tools in the Paint editor.

title: How can I colour the circles on the wings? 
---

The circles are outlines of a circle shape, so you can't use the **Fill** tool. 

+ First, click on a wing. 
+ Then, click on **Ungroup** to separate the objects.

+ Click on the circle that you separated on the wing.
+ Now, you can change the **Outline** colour for the circle.

Repeat these steps for the other wing. You can use the **Colour picker** tool to choose the same colour as you used for the other wing.
