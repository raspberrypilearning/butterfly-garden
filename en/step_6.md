## Challenge: Add to your garden

Now it's time to get creative with your butterfly garden. 

Try duplicating the Butterfly 4 sprite (the butterfly that flies around in circles) and changing the amount it moves and turns by. What happens?

Try changing the size of some of the butterflies so that some of them appear far away. 

Get creative and decorate your own butterfly costume with the paint tool.

How can I colour the circles on the wings? 
---

The circles are outlines of a circle shape so you can't use the fill tool. 

+ First click on a wing. 
+ Then click on Ungroup to separate the objects

+ Click on the circle on the wing you separated
+ Now you can change the Outline colour for the circle.

Repeat these steps for the other wing. You can use the colour picker to choose the same colour as you used for the other ring.
