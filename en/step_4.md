## Challenge: Add another butterfly

Duplicate Butterfly 2 to create Butterfly 3. Use what you have learned to make this butterfly different to the others. 

Change the colour of the butterfly's wings by editting its costume with the Fill tool.

Make your butterfly fly in a different direction. What happens if you choose a negative number?
