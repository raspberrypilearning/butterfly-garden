## Challenge: Add another butterfly

Duplicate Butterfly 2 to create Butterfly 3. Use what you have learned to give this butterfly a different colour and make it fly in a different pattern to the others. 

Make your butterfly fly in a different direction. What happens if you choose a negative number?
